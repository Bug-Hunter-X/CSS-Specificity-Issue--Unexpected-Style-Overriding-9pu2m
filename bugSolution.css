To solve the issue, we need to either make the `.myClass p` selector more specific or use the `!important` flag (though generally not recommended).  This solution modifies the selector to ensure the intended color is applied.

```css
.myClass p {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv p {
  color: blue !important; /*Use !important flag (not recommended)*/
}

.myClass #myDiv p { /* Making the selector more specific*/
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

The `!important` flag forces the style to be applied, regardless of specificity. However, using `!important` is often discouraged as it can make CSS difficult to maintain and debug. The better approach is to adjust selectors to make specificity work for you.
