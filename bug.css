The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where the specificity of selectors can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `#myDiv p` selector is more specific than the `.myClass p` selector, so the `color: blue;` declaration in the former will override the `color: red;` declaration in the latter.  This is known as CSS Specificity.  The unexpected behavior arises when developers don't fully understand this principle and assume that the later declaration will take precedence.

```css
.myClass p {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv p {
  color: blue;
}

#myDiv {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
